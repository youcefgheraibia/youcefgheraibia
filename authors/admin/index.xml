      <description>An award-winning researcher (National Innovation Award) with over 10 years of experience. Currently working as a Research Associate in the EU H2020 funded DEIS (Dependability Engineering Innovation for Cyber Physical Systems) project at the University of Hull. I received my Phd in Data processing from the University of Annaba (Algeria) in 2016.
I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in artificial intelligence for road safety and logistics including machine learning, optimization, data analysis and Model-based Safety Assessment of safety critical systems.</description>
